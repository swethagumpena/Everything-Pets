Everything Pets was built using usability engineering principles and concepts to help pet owners take better care of their pets. The user interface was designed from a user-centered approach, ensuring that it is intuitive and easy to navigate. The design process involved ideation, sketching, elaboration, and communication of user experiences and interface designs, with feedback gathered from pet owners to ensure that the application meets their needs. Prototyping was also done to refine the design and improve its usability. Techniques were used to improve the efficiency, learnability, and safety of the application. The app was evaluated using human-computer interaction principles to ensure that it provides a seamless experience for pet owners.
